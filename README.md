# ðŸ©ºBreast-cancer-Detection-Model
## Overview
This project is a machine learning-based solution for detecting breast tumors. Using Logistic Regression, we predict whether a breast tumor is malignant or benign. The project also includes detailed data visualization to understand the patterns and correlations in the dataset.  Using a dataset from Kaggle (download it from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data) or used the csv file of this repository.
## Whatâ€™s Inside
### This project includes:
* Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, scaling, and data transformation.
* Machine Learning Model: Implements Logistic Regression for classification.
* Performance Metrics: Evaluates the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score.
